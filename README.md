# Text-Classification-Feedback-Loop
Deploys trained ML Text Classification models and allows for user feedback to iterate and improve performance over time. 

## Prototype
Input any text and choose from up to 153 categories for prediction. Obtain results and manually correct predictions. The original text and feedback is stored in a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?hl=de) DataBase and can be used for further model training and tuning.
